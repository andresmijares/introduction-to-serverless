## Disclaimer 🥣
Use it on your own risk, I created this improvising some techniques to show in a meetup. Some services like the `users` table is not defined in the `serverless.yml` to show a purpose only but it's easy af to figure it out how to make it work taking a look around.

If you don't like it, please be aware that i don't give a fuck 🤷🏻‍♂️.
